# CSF.Validation

This project contains the core logic of the validation framework.
It should be referenced only by projects which configure dependency injection, typically part of an application's startup logic.
Other projects which consume validation should reference [CSF.Validation.Abstractions] instead.

This project corresponds to the NuGet package [CSF.Validation].
