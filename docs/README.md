# GitHub Pages documentation site

This directory contains the documentation website for CSF.Validation.
The site is published via [GitHub Pages].

*Do not edit the site from the code in this directory*; the site is auto-generated from
source code found in [the CSF.Validation.Documentation project] during the CI build process.
The published site files are only contained in the main branch in order to make it easier
to automatically publish.
