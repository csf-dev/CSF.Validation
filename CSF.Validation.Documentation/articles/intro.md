# Concepts

To use the validation framework in your own solution there are three conceptual steps:

1. [Configure the framework]
2. [Define how objects should be validated]
3. [Perform validation]

[Configure the framework]: ConfigureTheFramework.md
[Define how objects should be validated]: DefiningValidators.md
[Perform validation]: ConsumingValidators.md
