# Validation Manifests

The validation manifest is an object model which describes the configuration of a validator.
_In almost all cases, developers do not need to manipulate or work with a validation manifest directly._
Direct use of the validation manifest is an advanced feature; usually the [Validation Builders] or [Manifest Model] provides sufficient functionality.
