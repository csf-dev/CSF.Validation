# Validation Manifests

The validation manifest is an object model which describes the composition of a validator.

_In almost all cases, developers do not need to work with a validation manifest directly._
If you wish to create a validator using .NET code then consider using a [Validator Builder].
If you would like to define a validator using data then consider the [Manifest Model] instead.
Working with a validation manifest directly is an advanced technique which is definitely not required in the most common scenarios.
