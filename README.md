# .NET Validation Framework

This framework offers a mechanism to write _business logic validation_ services within your own application.
**CSF.Validation** is intended for non-trivial validation which lies at the heart of business processes.

It is designed so that developers may write their own validation logic/rules in self-contained classes that are individually testable.
A validator may be defined in code via a declarative/fluent builder API, or it may be created from data.

## Documentation

Detailed instructions & tutorials on how to use this framework are available on **[the documentation website]**.
