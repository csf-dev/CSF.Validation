# CSF Validation
Validation library, currently undergoing a rewrite from scratch.

The previous version is not particularly fit for use, and this rewrite is not yet ready for use.

### Continuous integration builds
CI builds are configured via both Travis (for build & test on Linux/Mono) and AppVeyor (Windows/.NET).
Below are links to the most recent build statuses for these two CI platforms.
