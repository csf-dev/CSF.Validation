# Validation framework abstractions

This package represents the abstractions and API definition for [CSF.Validation].
It is a small package without dependencies of its own, suitable for referencing from your own application projects which need to perform and consume validation.

Your application startup (where dependency injection is configured) should be the only project which needs to reference the main CSF.Validation package.

For more information, please see [the documentation website].
